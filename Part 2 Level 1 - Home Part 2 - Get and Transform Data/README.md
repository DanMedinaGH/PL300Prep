# Overview
Part 2 Level 1 Part 2 - Get and Transform Data of PL-3OO Prep series. <br/><br/>
Added Practice Activity 8 <br/><br/>
Source data comes from PowerBIData.xlsx from CDs and pvtHPAdmins<br/><br/>

# Data and Visual
For Part 2 Level Part 2 we continued transforming the dataset from the CDs spreadsheet <br/>
We continued exploring the Power Query Editor. <br/>
We sorted ascending and descending. <br/>
We split columns by different properties such as delimiter and positions. <br/>
We Grouped data by Columns and calculated summary data such as sum and count <br/>
We changed data type of data <br/>
We replaced values from columns <br/>

## Practice Activity 8
We applied all above steps to the pvtHPAdmins dataset. <br/>
The data in the stacked column chart visual was now aggregating properly <br/>
Because the date data was being interpreted hierarchically. <br/>
